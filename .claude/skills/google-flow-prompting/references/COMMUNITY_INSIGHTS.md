## Flow Strengths

### 1. Cinematic environmental footage
Veo 3.1 produces the most photorealistic nature footage among current
AI video generators. Water physics, fabric movement, hair dynamics,
smoke, and atmospheric particles (fog, dust, snow) render with high
fidelity. Establishing shots and nature B-roll are Flow's strongest
output category.

### 2. Camera control
Camera movements (dolly, crane, tracking, pan, arc) execute with high
accuracy and smoothness. Veo responds to precise cinematographic language
better than competitors. Lens simulation (shallow DOF, anamorphic,
macro) is reliable.

### 3. Native audio (Veo 3.1)
Unique competitive advantage. Dialogue with lip-sync, environmental
sound effects, ambient soundscapes, and experimental music generation —
all native, no post-processing required. Lip-sync quality was described
as "shockingly natural" by multiple reviewers for short dialogue scenes.

### 4. Free Fast mode on Ultra
Unlimited iteration at zero cost fundamentally changes the prompting
workflow. No other major platform offers this. Enables rapid prompt
refinement before committing credits to Quality renders.

### 5. Integrated creative workspace
Flow combines video generation, image generation (Imagen 4, free),
editing tools, Scenebuilder timeline, and Gemini-powered prompt
expansion — all in one interface. No tool-switching for basic pipeline.

### 6. Physics simulation
Real-world physics for water, cloth, hair, fire, and rigid body
interactions is stronger than Sora and Runway for most scenarios.
Pocket FM reported 30–40% user retention improvements using Veo 3.1
promotional content specifically due to visual quality.

## Flow Weaknesses

### 1. Character consistency across clips
The most significant limitation for narrative video. Characters generated
in separate prompts do not maintain visual consistency (face, clothing,
proportions) without the Ingredients workflow. Even with Ingredients,
consistency is approximate, not exact.

**Workaround:** Use verbatim character description sheets — identical
text across all prompts. Use Ingredients with reference images. Consider
Runway Gen-4 for character-dependent sequences.

### 2. Coherence degradation on extensions
Quality and coherence visibly decline after 2–3 Extend operations
(~16–24 seconds). Subjects drift, lighting shifts, motion becomes
unnatural. Practical maximum for usable extended footage is ~16 seconds.

**Workaround:** Design scenes within the 8-second limit. For longer
shots, generate separate clips and plan match cuts or dissolves.

### 3. Generated actors lack emotional range
Human figures tend toward bland, neutral expressions. Extreme emotions,
subtle micro-expressions, and complex body language are unreliable.
Actors' faces trend toward "AI generically attractive" rather than
distinctive or character-rich.

**Workaround:** Use Flow for wide/medium human shots. Reserve close-ups
of emotional faces for Sora 2 or stock footage.

### 4. Silent video bug
Audio only works reliably in Text-to-Video mode. Image-to-video,
Frames-to-Video, and Ingredients-to-Video modes frequently produce
silent output despite audio prompts. This is a known, persistent bug.

**Workaround:** Generate audio scenes exclusively in Text-to-Video mode.
Add audio to other modes in post-production.

### 5. Interface friction
Scenebuilder (timeline tool) is described as "confusing" and "not quite
ready for prime time." Capacity errors and failed generations are common
during peak hours — reports of 7/10 generations failing in some sessions.

**Workaround:** Generate during off-peak hours. Export clips and edit
in dedicated NLE (CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro).

### 6. Hands, fingers, and fine text
Like all current AI video models, Veo struggles with anatomically
correct hand rendering, especially in close-ups. On-screen text and
typography are unreliable — misspellings, deformed letters, phantom text.

**Workaround:** Frame shots to minimize hand visibility. Never include
on-screen text in generation prompts — add text in post-production.

## Known Failure Modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Silent video | Non-text-to-video mode | Use Text-to-Video only for audio |
| Unwanted subtitles baked in | Quotes around dialogue | Use colon syntax; add "No subtitles" |
| Generic/bland output | Prompt too short (<50 words) | Expand to 100-150 words |
| Incoherent scene | Prompt too long (>200 words) | Trim to 3-6 sentences |
| Capacity error / generation failure | Server load | Retry; try off-peak hours |
| Content policy block | Trigger words | Remove "prison", "China", "weapon", etc. and reword |
| Wrong camera movement | Ambiguous description | Use explicit cinematographic terms from keyword list |
| Character looks different each clip | No consistency mechanism | Use Ingredients + verbatim description |
| Extensions look off | Coherence degradation | Limit to 1-2 extensions max |
| Unwanted laugh track / music | No audio specification | Always specify audio explicitly |
| Low quality on Fast | Free tier trade-off | Expected — use Fast only for iteration |

## Multi-Tool Workflow

The production consensus (March 2026): ~75% of studios use 2–3 AI video
platforms simultaneously. Recommended allocation by role:

| Role | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Establishing shots** | Flow (Veo 3.1) | Best environmental/cinematic quality |
| **Nature B-roll** | Flow (Veo 3.1) | Best physics, atmosphere, water/fire |
| **Product/tech shots** | Flow (Veo 3.1) | Clean, controlled, commercial quality |
| **Dialogue scenes** | Flow (Veo 3.1) | Native audio + lip-sync |
| **Hero close-ups (human)** | Sora 2 | Best facial realism |
| **Character-consistent sequences** | Runway Gen-4 | Best cross-shot character identity |
| **Abstract/stylized visuals** | Runway Gen-4 | Best creative/artistic control |
| **Volume social content** | Kling | Cheapest per-clip, longest duration |
| **Image-to-video** | Kling | Industry-leading i2v workflow |

### Recommended per-scene decision flow

```
Is this an establishing/nature/atmosphere shot?
  → YES → Flow (Veo 3.1)
Does this scene require character consistency with other scenes?
  → YES → Runway Gen-4 (or Flow Ingredients if approximate is OK)
Is this a human close-up requiring emotion?
  → YES → Sora 2
Does this scene require native audio (dialogue/SFX)?
  → YES → Flow (Veo 3.1), Text-to-Video mode only
Is this abstract or heavily stylized?
  → YES → Runway Gen-4
Is this high-volume social content?
  → YES → Kling
Default → Flow (Veo 3.1)
```

## Content Policy Pitfalls

Flow's content policy is aggressive and sometimes blocks legitimate
creative prompts. Known trigger words and categories:

**Words that may cause generation failures:**
- Geographic/political: certain country names, political figures
- Violence-adjacent: "prison", "weapon", "blood", "fight"
- Medical: some medical terminology
- Age-related: descriptions of children in certain contexts

**Workaround strategy:**
1. Use euphemisms and abstractions where possible
2. Describe settings without naming specific countries
3. Avoid violence-adjacent vocabulary even in documentary contexts
4. Test trigger words in Fast mode (free) before committing Quality credits
5. If blocked, try rephrasing the same concept 2-3 times before switching tools

**Note:** Content policy false positives are a widely reported frustration.
Google has not published a complete list of restricted terms. Testing
in Fast mode at zero cost is the safest approach to discover blocks.
